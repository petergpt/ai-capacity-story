# The AI Computing Capacity Revolution

An interactive data story exploring the exponential growth of AI infrastructure worldwide.

## Overview

This React-based presentation analyzes 747 AI supercomputers globally, revealing the largest infrastructure buildout in human history. From the current 1.6 million H100 equivalents to over 80 million planned, we're witnessing a 50x multiplication of computing capacity that will enable artificial general intelligence.

## Key Findings

- **50x Capacity Multiplication**: Planned AI infrastructure represents a 50x increase over current reality
- **2026 Inflection Point**: A single year that will add 5.5x more capacity than exists today
- **Geographic Concentration**: USA, Middle East, and Asia Pacific will control 90%+ of global AI capacity
- **Corporate Arms Race**: Meta, Microsoft, xAI, and Google are betting everything on AI dominance

## Features

- üìä **Interactive Charts**: Beautiful visualizations using Recharts
- üé¨ **Smooth Animations**: Engaging transitions with Framer Motion
- üé® **Modern Design**: Sleek UI with Tailwind CSS
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys, spacebar, home/end
- üéÆ **Auto-play Mode**: Hands-off presentation capability
- üì± **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- üìà **Real Data**: Based on comprehensive analysis of 747 AI supercomputers
